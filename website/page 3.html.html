<p> <strong>	3.Where should a pilot of an aircraft start descent </strong><br/>
	An approach path for an aircraft ,as shown in the figure,satisfies the following conditions:<br/>  
	<li>The cruising altitude is  h  when the descent starts at a horizontal distance  l  from the touchtown at the origin<br/><li/>
	<li>The pilot maintains an uniform horizontal velocity u through out</li><br/>
	<li> The absolute value of the vertical acceleration must not exceed a constant  k ,which is less than the acceleration due to gravity.<br/>

 If the altitude  y  and the horizontal distance from the origin be  x ,then we assume<br/>
 y=ax<sup>3</sup>+bx<sup>2</sup>+cx+d. <br/>
 The conditions (1)(2)(3) give 6hv<sup>2</sup>/l<sup>2</sup>=K<br/>
 for a given k,v and h,the path and the horizontal distance l can be calculated.
