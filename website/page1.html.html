<p> <strong>1.When a dog chases a rabbit</strong><br/>
A dog sees a rabbit running in a straight line across an open field and gives chase.In a rectangular co-ordinate system (as given in the Figure below),we assume:

</center>
The rabbit is at the origin and the dog is at the point (L,0)  at the instant the dog first sees the rabbit.
    <li>The rabbit runs up the  y-axis  and the dog always runs straight for the rabbit.</li>
    <li> The dog has same speed as the rabbit.</li>


If the dog moves along the path whose equation is y=f(x) ,then it can be shown that  y  satisfies the differential equation<br/>

 x d.<sup>2</sup>y/dx<sub>2</sub><br/>


with the initial conditions  y=0, dy/dx=0  when  x=0 <br/>

 y=X<sup>2</sup>-L<sup>2</sup>/4L-1/2L   log(X/L) <br/>

It will be interesting to find that the dog will never be able to catch the rabbit.<br/>
