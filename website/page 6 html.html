<p><strong>6.The calculus of Rainbow</strong><br/>
	
	Rainbow in the sky have fascinated mankind from ancient times.<br/>Formation of rainbow is a beautiful phenomenon of nature caused by scattering of sunlight by waterdrops floating in the air.<br/>
	The formation of rainbow can be explained in the following way.<br/>
	A ray of light meets the spherical surface of the raindrop at A,<br/>after refraction it takes up the path along AB inside the drop,at B the ray suffers total internal refraction to move along BC.<br/>At C it is refracted again to emerge out of the raindrop. <br/>
If &Alpha; be the angle of incidence of the ray of light at A,then D (&Alpha;)  ,the amount of clockwise deviation that the ray has undergone during this three -stage process.<br/>
Thus,D(&Alpha;)=(&Alpha;-&Beta;)+(&pi;-2&Beta;)+(&Alpha;-&Beta;)=&pi/&Alpha;-4&Beta<br/>

A little calculus will show that D is minimum when  &Alpha;=59.4 and D<sub>min</sub>=138<br/>
The above figure shows that the angle of elevation from the observer upto the highest point of the rainbow is (180-138)=42
